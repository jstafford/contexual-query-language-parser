Contextual Query Language parser in JavaScript
==========================================

A hand-written, recursive descent parser of the Contextual Query Language as
used in the standardized information retrieval protocolâ€”Search/Retrieval via
URL (SRU).

The parser can be used in places where the front-end query analysis is
required (e.g search UIs, etc).

Based on the original work of Jakub Skoczen, with updates from Jason Stafford
to make it a node package and move it into the ES6 world.

language: [CQL specs](http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/cql/)
